### ENGR110-01 Team 11A

##Inputs and Outputs
Given geographic coordinates in degrees/minutes/seconds, the calculator will convert them into vectors.
There are three options given in the CLI environment:
1. DEG / MIN / SEC ===> Decimal Degrees
2. Decimal Degrees ===> Vector
3. DEG / MIN / SEC ===> Vector

##Navigation
When the program is run, a menu of options (listed above in **Inputs and Outputs**) will appear and the user is prompted for their choice. Upon the choice of option 1, 2, or 3, a second prompt will appear for the user to input sufficient information for the program to perform the conversions needed.
When the user is finished, they can enter ``q`` to exit.
